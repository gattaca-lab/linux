===================================
  TBI support for RISCV
===================================

Introduction
------------

The goal of the current implementation is to enable fast prototyping of
TBI-dependent SW stack.

The implementation is "heavily inspired" (one could say that this is a rip off)
by aarch64 code base and ARMv8 architecture.

Required HW Support
-------------------

Register: CSR_TBICONTROL (0x9c0)

  +---------------------------------+
  |   Name                 | bits   |
  +----------------------------------
  |  Reserved              | [63:1] |
  +---------------------------------+
  |  TBI_ENABLE            |  [0]   |
  +---------------------------------+

If CSR_TBICONTROL.TBI_ENABLE is set to one, then for all memory references
bits [63:56] of the resulting address ignored.

*NOTE:* to simplify the design of a relevant OS subsystem(s), we assume that
TBI is active only for memory references which have bits [55:39] set to zero,
that is TBI should affect only for "user-space" addresses.

Implementation
--------------

*thread_struct* kernel structure was extended to include the "TBI" field.

When context switching happens, the current value of CSR_TBICONTROL is saved
to thread_struct::TBI. This value is restored once we switch back.

We expect that the current value of CSR_TBICONTROL should not affect "kernel
addresses". Currently, our QEMU implementation does not do that - this will be
addressed in the future.

To set CSR_TBICONTROL for the current thread an application should call

.. code-block:: c
   prctl(PR_SET_TAGGED_ADDR_CTRL, PR_TAGGED_ADDR_ENABLE, 0, 0, 0)

In a manner similar to what described in `arm64/tagged-address-abi.rst`.

The key difference is that while AARCH64 ABI for Linux allows userspace
to use "tagged" pointers by default, RISCV architecture does not allow that.
In AArch64 the purpose of `PR_SET_TAGGED_ADDR_CTRL` syscall is to relax
the ABI by allowing to pass tagged pointers to syscalls. In RISCV the intention
is to enable both TBI and to allow passing pointers to syscalls.

Limitations
-----------

Our current implementation has several restrictions (all are WIP):

* Passing of tagged pointers to syscalls is not supported.
* sysctl - based interface to forbid enabling of TBI is not supported.
* CSR_TBICONTROL.TBI_ENABLE should not affect "kernel" addresses (the ones
which have all bits from [55:39] range set).
